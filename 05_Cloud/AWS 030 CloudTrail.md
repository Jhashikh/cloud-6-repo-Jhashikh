# AWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail enables auditing, security monitoring, and operational troubleshooting. CloudTrail records user activity and API usage across AWS services as Events. CloudTrail Events help you answer the questions of "who did what, where, and when?"

CloudTrail records two types of events: Management events capturing control plane actions on resources such as creating or deleting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and data events capturing data plane actions within a resource, such as reading or writing an Amazon S3 object.

CloudTrail uses these events in three features:

Trails enables delivery and storage of events in Amazon S3, with optional delivery to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and EventBridge.
Insights analyzes control plane events for anomalous behavior in API call volumes.
Event history provides a 90-day history of control plane actions for free. As part of its core audit capabilities, CloudTrail provides customer managed keys for encryption and log file validation to guarantee immutability.
