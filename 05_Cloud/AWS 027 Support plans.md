# AWS Support plans
AWS Support offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support the success and operational health of your AWS solutions. All support plans provide 24/7 access to customer service, AWS documentation, technical papers, and support forums. For technical support and more resources to plan, deploy, and improve your AWS environment, you can choose a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.

**Features of AWS Support plans**
AWS Support offers five support plans:

* Basic

* Developer

* Business

* Enterprise On-Ramp

* Enterprise

Basic Support offers support for account and billing questions and service quota increases. The other plans offer a number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and no long-term contracts.

In the AWS Management Console, you can create three types of customer cases in AWS Support:

* **Account and billing support cases** are available to all AWS customers. You can get help with billing and account questions.

* **Service limit increase requests** are available to all AWS customers. For more information about the default service quotas, formerly referred to as limits, see AWS service quotas in the AWS General Reference.

* **Technical support cases** connect you to technical support for help with service-related technical issues and, in some cases, third-party applications. If you have a Developer Support plan, you can communicate by using email and the Support Center. If you have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you can also communicate by phone or live chat.
