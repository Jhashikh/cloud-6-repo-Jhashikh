# Conditions
## Introduction:
Very often, you will want to run a piece of code only when certain conditions are met. For example, you might want to write something to an error log only if an error occurred.
Python makes use of the if, elif, and else statements

**Python Conditions and If statements** 
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

* Equals: a == b
* Not Equals: a != b
* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
**Elif**
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

**Else**
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
