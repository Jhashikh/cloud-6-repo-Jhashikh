AWS-17 Well Architected Framework

# Well Architected Framework
The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs. To help designing architectures, AWS has the Well Architected Framework (WAF, not to be confused with the Web Application Firewall).
WAF consists of five pillars, all wd be able to name thith their own key concepts, design principles, and best practices. 

The mnemonic device for the five pillars is CROPSS(the first letter of each pillar). The pillars are:
Cost optimization
Reliability
Operational Excellence
Performance efficiency
Security
Sustainability
AWS has them ordered as OSRPC, but thatâ€™s a little harder to remember.
